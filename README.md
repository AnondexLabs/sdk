# 🕶️ AnonDex

**AnonDex protects WHO executes your transactions, not just how.**  
Financial privacy is a fundamental right.

AnonDex is a privacy-first decentralized exchange infrastructure that focuses on **executor anonymity** — ensuring that not only transaction data, but also *who* executes and routes transactions remains private.

> In a world where MEV, surveillance, and wallet fingerprinting are the norm, AnonDex restores financial privacy at the execution layer.
